"The authorization token I'm using will change over time. Every time we run the code or when the token expires, we'll need to update the AUTH_TOKEN in your code with the new one. 
If we don't update it, we will likely encounter an error such as 'Invalid authorization token' or '401 Unauthorized', and the output will not be fetched correctly from the API."
