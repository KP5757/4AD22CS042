"The authorization token you're using will change over time. Every time you run the code or when the token expires, you'll need to update the AUTH_TOKEN in your code with the new one. 
If you don't update it, you will likely encounter an error such as 'Invalid authorization token' or '401 Unauthorized', and the output will not be fetched correctly from the API."
